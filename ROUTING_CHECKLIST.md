# üîÑ Routing Configuration Checklist

This checklist ensures all routing configurations are properly set up for deployment.

## ‚úÖ Frontend Routing Files

### 1. `_redirects` file
**Location**: `frontend/public/_redirects`
**Content**:
```
# Handle client-side routing for React Router
/* /index.html 200
```
**Purpose**: Ensures all routes serve index.html for React Router to handle client-side routing.

### 2. `netlify.toml` (Frontend)
**Location**: `frontend/netlify.toml`
**Content**:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "build"
  base = "/"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"

[dev]
  command = "npm start"
  port = 3000
  targetPort = 3000
```
**Purpose**: Configures build settings and SPA routing for Netlify.

### 3. `static.json`
**Location**: `frontend/static.json`
**Content**:
```json
{
  "root": "build/",
  "clean_urls": false,
  "routes": {
    "/**": "index.html"
  },
  "https_only": true,
  "headers": {
    "/**": {
      "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
    },
    "/static/**": {
      "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    }
  }
}
```
**Purpose**: Additional routing and caching configuration for static sites.

## ‚úÖ Backend Routing Files

### 4. Root `netlify.toml`
**Location**: `netlify.toml`
**Content**:
```toml
[build]
  command = "echo 'No build command needed for root'"
  publish = "."

# Update these redirects with your actual backend deployment URL
# For example, if your backend is deployed at https://your-backend.herokuapp.com
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "https://your-backend-deployment-url.com/api/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/socket.io/*"
  to = "https://your-backend-deployment-url.com/socket.io/:splat"
  status = 200
  force = true
```
**Purpose**: Proxies API and Socket.IO requests to your deployed backend.

## üîç Verification Steps

1. **Check that all files exist in correct locations**
   - [ ] `frontend/public/_redirects`
   - [ ] `frontend/netlify.toml`
   - [ ] `frontend/static.json`
   - [ ] `netlify.toml` (root)

2. **Verify file contents**
   - [ ] [_redirects](file:///C:/Users/rishu/OneDrive/Desktop/Chat-now/frontend/public/_redirects) file has correct format: `/* /index.html 200`
   - [ ] Frontend [netlify.toml](file:///C:/Users/rishu/OneDrive/Desktop/Chat-now/frontend/netlify.toml) has SPA routing configuration
   - [ ] Root [netlify.toml](file:///C:/Users/rishu/OneDrive/Desktop/Chat-now/netlify.toml) has proxy configuration for API and Socket.IO

3. **After deployment**
   - [ ] Test direct access to routes like `/login` and `/chat`
   - [ ] Refresh pages to ensure no 404 errors
   - [ ] Check browser console for routing errors

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If you still see 404 errors:
1. Verify the [_redirects](file:///C:/Users/rishu/OneDrive/Desktop/Chat-now/frontend/public/_redirects) file is in `frontend/public/` directory
2. Check that the file contains exactly: `/* /index.html 200`
3. Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters
4. Redeploy your site to Netlify

### If API calls fail:
1. Update the root [netlify.toml](file:///C:/Users/rishu/OneDrive/Desktop/Chat-now/netlify.toml) with your actual backend URL
2. Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` and `REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL` environment variables in Netlify dashboard
3. Ensure your backend is deployed and accessible
